<p><strong>Tiramisu</strong> is a timelees no-bake Italian dessert combining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and a creamy lightlysweetened mascarpone cream.This recipe is from the late Maida Heatter and is easily the best homemade tiramisu recipe that I've ever tried</p>
<br>
A couple month ago, I was sent a new cookbook called Happiness is Baking.This cookbook includes Maida heatter's faorite recipes with the foreword written by Dorie Greenspan. I, unsurprisingly, immediately fell in love with my newest cookbook.It's a collection of 100 foolproof and cassic dessert icluding cookies, cakes, muffins,pies, tarts, and more that range from simle everydaycookies to outrageously indulgen chocolate souffle cake.

<ul>
        <li>1 and 1/4 cups (300ml) very strongly prepared espresso, warm or room temperature</li>

    <p>For those not familiar, Maida Heatter is an icon, especially in the baking world. Dubbed the Queen of Cake, her expansive culinary career included 9 cookbooks, recipes for the Times, a restaurant, and three James Beard Awards. Baker and author Dorie Greenspan once said <q>Whenever someone tells me they want to learn to bake, I tell them to start with Maida Heatter's books. That's what I did.</q> This latest cookbook is a testament to Maida's legacy. She passed away only 2 months afer this book was published. She leaves behind an incalculable amount of inspirstion to bakers and cooks all over the world. </p>

<h2>Common Tiramisu Questions-Answered</h2>
<br/>
<h3>What kind of rum do I use in tirmisu?</h3>
<blockquote>Dark rum is best, but you can use brandy or your favorite coffee liqueur.</blockquote>
<h3>Egg whites or whpped cream?</h3>
<blockquote>Most tiramisu recipes use whipped egg whites OR whipped cream in the  masacarpone cream layers. Egg whites contribute a more airy texture, while whipped cream makes the filling a bit more rich. This recipe actually uses both, so you're getting both delightful textures..</blockquote>
<h3>Are the eggs cooked?</h3>
<blockquote>Tiramisu is a no-bake dessert. The egg yolks are gently cooked on the stovetop, but the egg whites are raw. Purchase pasteurized eggs because they are safe to consume raw.</blockquote>
<h3>What size pan to use?</h3>
<blockquote>This particular tiramisu recipe yields a large volume and the pan will be very full. Make sure your pan is large enough. I recommend a 9X13 inch dish with at least a 12-14 cup capacity. This 4 quart dish is wonderful too. </blockquote>
